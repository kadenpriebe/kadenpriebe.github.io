# Project Context - Kaden Priebe Personal Website

## Goal
Build a personality-driven, interactive personal portfolio website for Kaden Priebe (Cornell student, researcher, builder). The site should be memorable, fun, and warm.

## Core Features
- Interactive elements: Floating stickers, sidebar widgets, micro-animations.
- Minigames: Scattered throughout with a persistent global leaderboard.
- Personality: Conversational naming, Easter eggs, authentic writing voice.
- Content: About, Projects (with stubs), Blog, Links/Socials.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 + React 19 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animations:** Motion (Framer Motion) + GSAP
- **Backend/DB:** Supabase (for leaderboard)
- **Hosting:** Vercel + Custom Domain
- **Content:** MDX

## Constraints & Principles
- **Performance:** Server-first rendering with client component islands to keep bundles small.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Content must be readable without JS.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure core usability despite interactive elements.
- **Mobile First:** Stickers and games must be adapted for small screens.

## Reference Styles
- Warm palettes (cream, peach, soft cyan).
- Ali Abdaal / Wyatt Sell / Cornell academic vibes.
