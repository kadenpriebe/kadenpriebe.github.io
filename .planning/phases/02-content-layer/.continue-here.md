<current_state>
Phase 2 (Content Injection & Content Layer) is moving quickly. Task 2 (Projects Infrastructure) is now complete. The projects system mirrors the blog's MDX-based approach and supports project-specific metadata like GitHub and demo links. The entire site builds successfully with SSG. Ready for Task 3: About Page Content & Now Page.

<remaining_work>

- Task 3: About Page Content & Now Page - Not yet started
  - Create `/about` page with personal narrative
  - Build `/now` page with current activities/status
  - Ensure both are styled consistently with the design system
