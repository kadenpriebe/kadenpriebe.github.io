# Summary: Phase 1, Plan 01 — Foundation & Theme Setup

## Accomplishments
- **Project Initialized:** Next.js 16 (React 19) project scaffolded with App Router and TypeScript.
- **Minimalist Light Palette Configured:** Tailwind CSS v4 configured with a white background (`#ffffff`) and near-black text (`#1a1a1a`) inspired by Lillian Lee and wyattsell.com.
- **Layout Primitives Created:** `Container` and `Section` components implemented in `src/components/ui/` to ensure consistent spacing and alignment.
- **Home Page Updated:** Cleaned up boilerplate and implemented a simple, centered foundation layout using the new theme and components.

## Verification Results
- **package.json:** Confirmed Next.js 16.1.6 and React 19.2.3.
- **globals.css:** Verified `@theme` contains brand color variables.
- **Responsive Layout:** `Container` provides max-width and padding for desktop and mobile.

## Next Steps
- Start **Plan 01-02: Structural Shell & Conversational Nav**.
- Implement the site header and navigation using conversational naming (e.g., "who's this guy?").
