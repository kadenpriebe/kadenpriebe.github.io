# Summary: Phase 1, Plan 02 — Structural Shell & Conversational Nav

## Accomplishments
- **Metadata & Fonts:** Configured global SEO metadata and custom fonts. Using `Plus Jakarta Sans` for headings and `Geist Sans` for body text.
- **Conversational Navigation:** Created a responsive `Nav` component with conversational labels:
  - "who's this guy?" (About)
  - "what i've built" (Projects)
  - "random thoughts" (Blog)
  - "let's talk" (Links)
- **Global Shell:** Integrated `Nav`, `Footer`, and a sticky header layout into `RootLayout`.
- **Dependencies Added:** Installed `lucide-react` for icons and `framer-motion` for animations.

## Verification Results
- **Responsive Nav:** Verified mobile hamburger menu functionality (via code logic) and desktop horizontal layout.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** Verified high-contrast black-on-white theme remains consistent across the shell.
- **Sticky Header:** Navigation bar is sticky with a backdrop blur for a modern feel.

## Next Steps
- Start **Plan 01-03: Core Page Skeletons & Verification**.
- Create placeholder pages for `/about`, `/projects`, `/blog`, and `/links` to verify routing.
