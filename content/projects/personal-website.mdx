This website is an experiment in digital gardening. Instead of a static portfolio that gathers dust, I wanted a living system where I could easily plant ideas (blog posts), grow projects, and showcase the tools I use to learn.

## The Goal

Make it personal. Make it fast. Make it easy to update.

I wanted a site that felt like *me*—a bit minimalist but with personality. I also wanted to ensure that adding new content didn't require a full redeploy or complex CMS management.

## Technical Choices

- **Next.js (App Router):** For the robust routing and server components.
- **Tailwind CSS v4:** For rapid styling and a design system that scales.
- **MDX:** To write content in Markdown but embed interactive React components (like my [PCA Explorer](/coursework/cs-3780-pca)).
- **Vercel:** for seamless deployment.

## How it works

The site is statically generated. Content lives in a local `content/` directory as MDX files. At build time, Next.js reads these files, parses the frontmatter (metadata), and renders the pages. This gives me the best of both worlds: the speed of a static site and the flexibility of a dynamic app.

## Future Plans

- Adding a `/now` page to share what I'm currently focused on.
- Building more interactive learning tools for my coursework.
- Experimenting with 3D elements using Three.js.
