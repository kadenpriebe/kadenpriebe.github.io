# hello world

This is the first post on my new site. I'm building this using **Next.js 16**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **MDX**.

## why a blog?

Because sharing thoughts is fun, and having a place to document what I'm learning is even better.

### code test

```tsx
const hello = () => {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
};
```

Stay tuned for more!
