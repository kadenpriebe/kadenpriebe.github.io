I built this interactive explorer to better understand how PCA works under the hood, specifically focusing on the relationship between data rotation and the covariance matrix.

## How it was made

This tool was created using React and SVG. The goal was to visualize:
1. **Covariance Matrix**: How the spread and tilt of data are captured in a 2x2 matrix.
2. **Orthogonal Transforms**: How rotation matrices preserve lengths and angles (O⊤O = I).
3. **The Connection**: How rotating data by O transforms the covariance matrix Σ into OΣO⊤.

### Key Learnings
- Eigenvectors point along the principal components of the data.
- Eigenvalues represent the variance along those components.
- Orthogonal transformations are essentially "rigid" rotations or reflections.
